Monologue is a basic mountable blogging engine in Rails built to be easily mounted in an already existing Rails app, but it can also be used alone.

## Version

This README is for a future Monologue version, that will be 0.4.X and be Rails 4 specific. See other branches for other versions (0-3-stable being the latest stable version).

## Upgrade and changes

To know how to upgrade, see [UPGRADE.md](https://github.com/jipiboily/monologue/blob/master/UPGRADE.md) file. If you want to know what changed since the last versions, see [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/jipiboily/monologue/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

- tested
- back to basics: few features
- tags (or categories)
- RSS
- multiple users
- support for Google Analytics and Gaug.es tags
- few external dependencies (no Devise or Sorcery, etcâ€¦) so we don't face problem integrating with existing Rails app.([Rails mountable engines: dependency nightmare?](http://jipiboily.com/2012/rails-mountable-engines-dependency-nightmare))
- comments are handled by [disqus](http://disqus.com/)
- more in the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/jipiboily/monologue/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

### missing features
- see [roadmap](https://github.com/jipiboily/monologue/wiki/Roadmap)!


## Installation
### 1. Add the gem to your `Gemfile`. This will get the latest version compatible with Rails 4 until we release a gem
```ruby
gem 'monologue', github: 'jipiboily/monologue'
```
And run `bundle install` to fetch the gem and update your 'Gemfile.lock'.

### 2. Route to Monologue

Add this to your route file (`config/route.rb`)
```ruby
# This line mounts Monologue's routes at the root of your application.
# This means, any requests to URLs such as /my-post, will go to Monologue::PostsController.
# If you would like to change where this engine is mounted, simply change the :at option to something different.
#
# We ask that you don't use the :as option here, as Monologue relies on it being the default of "monologue"
mount Monologue::Engine, at: '/' # or whatever path, be it "/blog" or "/monologue"
```
For example, if you decide to mount it at  `/blog`, the admin section will be available at `/blog/monologue`.
Here we decide to use monologue as default route mounting it at `/`, it means that the admin section will directly
be available at `/monologue`.

### 3. Migrate Monologue's database tables
Run these commands:

0. $`bundle exec rails g migration...`
1. $`bundle exec rake monologue:install:migrations`
2. $`bundle exec rake db:create` (only if this is a new project)
3. $`bundle exec rake db:migrate`


### 4. Create a user
Open your development console with `rails c`, then:
```ruby
Monologue::User.create(name: "monologue", email:"monologue@example.com", password:"my-password", password_confirmation: "my-password")
```

### 5. Configure Monologue.
This is all done in an initializer file, say `config/initializers/monologue.rb`. More on this in the [Wiki - Configuration](https://github.com/jipiboily/monologue/wiki/Configuration).

### 6. Ready
Start your server and head on [http://localhost:3000/monologue](http://localhost:3000/monologue) to log in the admin section.


### Note to users
Monologue is using his own tables. If you want to use your own tables with monologue (for example the User table)
this might help you to monkey patch [Monkey Patch](https://gist.github.com/jipiboily/776d907fc932640ac59a)

## Customization
See the [Wiki - Customizations](https://github.com/jipiboily/monologue/wiki/Customizations).

## Requirements
- Rails 4.0.4 +
- Database: MySQL & Postgres are supported but other databases might work too.
